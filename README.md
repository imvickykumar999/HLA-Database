# `HLA Database`

```
DKMS uses a matching algorithm that compares the HLA type
of the patient with those of registered donors in the database.

**DKMS** stands for **Dynamic Kernel Module Support**, which is a framework used to automatically rebuild and install kernel modules when a new kernel version is installed. It helps to keep kernel modules compatible across kernel upgrades without needing manual intervention. It is typically used in Linux systems for managing kernel modules such as those for proprietary drivers.

**BMST** could refer to a few different things depending on context, but it's commonly associated with either:

1. **Battery Management System Test** (BMST), which refers to the testing and management of battery systems, especially in electric vehicles or power storage systems.
   
2. **BMST Medical Test**, often referring to a blood test used for bone marrow screening.

**HLA** stands for **Human Leukocyte Antigen**, which is a group of proteins found on the surface of most cells in the human body. These proteins play a crucial role in the immune system by helping the body distinguish between its own cells and foreign invaders, like viruses or bacteria.

HLA typing is especially important in **organ and bone marrow transplants** because it helps match donors and recipients to reduce the risk of transplant rejection. Matching the HLA types between the donor and recipient improves the chances of a successful transplant.

The probability of siblings having a matching **HLA** (Human Leukocyte Antigen) type is approximately **25%**.

This is because each child inherits half of their HLA genes from their mother and half from their father. There are four possible combinations of HLA types that siblings can inherit from their parents:

1. Both siblings inherit the same HLA set from both parents (a full match).
2. One sibling inherits a different set from one parent but the same from the other.
3. Both siblings inherit entirely different HLA sets from both parents.

Given the independent combinations, the probability of any two siblings being a **full HLA match** (i.e., having identical HLA types) is 1 in 4, or 25%. There is also a 50% chance that they will be a half match (sharing one HLA haplotype), and a 25% chance of no match.

This probability only applies to siblings with the same biological parents.

In the context of **DKMS** (the global nonprofit organization focused on stem cell and bone marrow donor registration), they use a **donor database** to filter and find matching donors for patients in need of a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The matching process relies on **HLA typing** to ensure compatibility between the donor and the recipient.

Here’s how DKMS might use their database to filter for matching donors:

### 1. **Collection of Donor HLA Data**
   - When an individual registers as a potential donor with DKMS, they provide a cheek swab or blood sample, which is then analyzed to determine their **HLA type**.
   - The donor’s **HLA profile** is stored in DKMS’s database along with their personal and contact information.

### 2. **Patient HLA Typing**
   - Similarly, when a patient requires a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, their **HLA type** is determined by their medical team and sent to DKMS or other donor registries.

### 3. **Database Filtering and Matching Algorithm**
   - DKMS uses a **matching algorithm** that compares the **HLA type** of the patient with those of registered donors in the database.
   - The database is filtered to find potential donors who have the same or highly similar HLA types to the patient.
   - Matching is critical because a close or identical HLA match between the donor and patient reduces the risk of transplant rejection.

### 4. **Probability and Priority of Matching**
   - Since the chances of finding a perfect match (especially outside of immediate family members) can be low, DKMS and similar organizations often maintain large international databases, working with other registries globally to increase the pool of potential matches.
   - The algorithm also accounts for factors like the **frequency of the HLA type** in the population and may prioritize donors based on proximity, health status, and availability for donation.

### 5. **Additional Filtering Criteria**
   - Besides HLA matching, DKMS might use other filters such as:
     - **Age**
     - **Health conditions**
     - **Geographic location**
     - **Donor availability** for further testing and donation procedures

Once potential matches are found, DKMS contacts the donors for further testing and evaluation to ensure they are suitable to donate.
